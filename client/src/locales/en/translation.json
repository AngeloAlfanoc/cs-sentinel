    "about_paragraph_1": "CS2 is a player-driven cheat jurisdiction process initially modeled after the Overwatch system in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but now applied outside the game environment. This system works alongside traditional security measures and enlists experienced and trustworthy application users, designated as Investigators, who review usage logs and data contexts with suspected unauthorized activities.",
    "about_paragraph_2": "Investigators assess the information to determine whether the user in question has engaged in cheating or has compromised the application's integrity. A verdict of \"guilty\" leads to consequences such as access bans or restrictions imposed on the offender's account.",
    "about_paragraph_3": "To participate as an Investigator in CS2, users must have a proven activity record and cannot have their involvement obscured by inactivity. If an Investigator's participation eligibility lapses due to inactivity, they must re-establish their active status to regain access to the CS2 system. As noted in the update on March 22, 2023, the original Overwatch feature was phased out from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and this change was reflected in the application-based adaptation.",
